# masquerade-nodes-comfyui
Masquerade Nodes ComfyUI is a node pack designed for ComfyUI, focusing on creating and manipulating masks for images with functionalities such as automatic photobashing, high-resolution face inpainting, and filtering images based on specific objects or concepts. It leverages the Mask by Text node, utilizing ClipSeg to dynamically generate masks from images using text prompts, and includes additional nodes for mask morphology, combining masks, and operations on images and masks to facilitate complex image editing and manipulation workflows without dependencies.
