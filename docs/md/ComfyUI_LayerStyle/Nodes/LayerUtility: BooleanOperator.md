# LayerUtility: Boolean Operator
## Documentation
- Class name: `LayerUtility: BooleanOperator`
- Category: `ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerUtility/Data`
- Output node: `False`

This node performs a variety of boolean operations between two inputs based on a specified operator. It abstracts the complexity of conditional logic into a simple interface, allowing users to easily implement logical conditions and comparisons within their data flows.
## Input types
### Required
- **`a`**
    - The first input for the boolean operation. Its role varies based on the chosen operator, acting either as a standalone value for unary operations or one of the operands for binary operations.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Union[int, float, bool, str]`
- **`b`**
    - The second input for the boolean operation, serving as the other operand in binary operations. It is not used in unary operations like 'not(a)'.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Union[int, float, bool, str]`
- **`operator`**
    - Specifies the boolean operation to be performed. It supports a range of operators including comparison, logical, and bitwise operations, directly influencing the outcome of the node.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Output types
- **`output`**
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - The result of the boolean operation, indicating the truth value of the applied condition.
    - Python dtype: `bool`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
