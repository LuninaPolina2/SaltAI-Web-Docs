# LayerUtility: PrintInfo
## Documentation
- Class name: `LayerUtility: PrintInfo`
- Category: `ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerUtility/Data`
- Output node: `True`

The 'LayerUtility: PrintInfo' node is designed to log and return information about the input it receives, including the type of the input, dimensions and shape if it's a tensor, and serialization of the input if possible. It's a utility node aimed at providing insights into the data flowing through a node pipeline, facilitating debugging and data inspection.
## Input types
### Required
- **`anything`**
    - Accepts any type of input, aiming to provide detailed information about it, including its type, dimensions if applicable, and a serialized form. This flexibility allows for a wide range of data types to be inspected, making it a versatile tool for debugging and data analysis.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `AnyType`
## Output types
- **`text`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Outputs a string containing detailed information about the input, including its type, dimensions if applicable, and serialized form, aiding in debugging and data inspection.
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
