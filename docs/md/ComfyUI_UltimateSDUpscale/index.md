# ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale
ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale provides nodes for the Ultimate Stable Diffusion Upscale script by Coyote-A, designed to be used with the A1111 extension. It acts as a wrapper, allowing users to upscale images with various options, including the ability to handle already upscaled images or to apply custom sampling and sigmas for more control over the upscaling process.
