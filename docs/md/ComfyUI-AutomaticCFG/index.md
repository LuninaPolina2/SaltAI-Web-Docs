# ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG
ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG is a project that introduces a self-rescaling CFG (Control Flow Graph) / anti-burn technique designed to enhance image generation processes, making them faster and reducing the likelihood of generating artifacts. It features custom attention modifiers, interesting presets, temperature scaling, and compatibility with various models including SD3, provided certain features are not used. The project aims to improve the quality and speed of image generation by automatically adjusting the CFG scale during the sampling process, offering presets that can significantly alter the generation behavior and outcomes.
