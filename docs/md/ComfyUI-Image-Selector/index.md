# ComfyUI-Image-Selector
ComfyUI-Image-Selector is a custom node designed for ComfyUI, aimed at selecting specific images from a batch for further processing or saving. It addresses the limitation of ComfyUI in handling batch generation seeds by allowing users to select images based on their index or a range, facilitating operations like scaling up or applying high-resolution fixes.
