# üß™Inject I2V into AnimateDiff Model üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: `ADE_InjectI2VIntoAnimateDiffModel`
- Category: `Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/AnimateLCM-I2V/üß™experimental`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to inject an Image-to-Video (I2V) model into an existing AnimateDiff model, enhancing its capabilities with I2V features. It focuses on integrating specific I2V components into the AnimateDiff framework to enable or improve motion-based animations.
## Input types
### Required
- **`model_name`**
    - Specifies the name of the model to be loaded and modified. It is crucial for identifying the correct AnimateDiff model to which the I2V features will be added.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`motion_model`**
    - Represents the motion model patcher object that will be modified to include I2V features. It is essential for applying the I2V enhancements to the specified AnimateDiff model.
    - Comfy dtype: `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`
    - Python dtype: `MotionModelPatcher`
### Optional
- **`ad_settings`**
    - Optional settings for the AnimateDiff model that can be adjusted during the I2V injection process. These settings allow for customization and fine-tuning of the model's behavior.
    - Comfy dtype: `AD_SETTINGS`
    - Python dtype: `AnimateDiffSettings`
- **`deprecation_warning`**
    - Provides a warning message about the experimental status of this node, indicating that it may not function as expected. This parameter allows for communication of potential risks to the user.
    - Comfy dtype: `ADEWARN`
    - Python dtype: `Dict[str, Union[str, str, str]]`
## Output types
- **`MOTION_MODEL`**
    - Comfy dtype: `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`
    - The modified AnimateDiff model with I2V features injected. This output represents the enhanced model ready for use in motion-based animations.
    - Python dtype: `MotionModelPatcher`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `GPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
