# ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion
ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion is an extension designed to enable large image drawing and upscaling with limited VRAM by utilizing two state-of-the-art diffusion tiling algorithms, Mixture of Diffusers and MultiDiffusion, along with a Tiled VAE algorithm. It supports features like SDXL model, ControlNet, Tiled VAE, Img2img upscale, and ultra-large image generation, aiming to improve image processing efficiency and quality in environments with restricted hardware resources.
