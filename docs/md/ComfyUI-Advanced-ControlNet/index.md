# ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet
ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet is designed to enhance the scheduling and application of ControlNet strength across different timesteps and batched latents in AI models, offering advanced features like custom weights and attention masks. It supports a variety of ControlNet types and integrates features for prioritizing prompts or ControlNet influence in the generation process. The project also facilitates sliding context sampling and provides tools for detailed scheduling through timestep and latent keyframes, enabling precise control over the application of ControlNets during the AI's sampling process.
