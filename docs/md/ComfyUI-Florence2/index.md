# ComfyUI-Florence2
ComfyUI-Florence2 is an advanced vision foundation model designed for a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks, capable of interpreting text prompts for captioning, object detection, and segmentation using its FLD-5B dataset. It introduces a new feature for Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA), enabling users to extract information from document images by asking questions and receiving answers based on the visual and textual content of the documents.
