# Deploying and running workflows on Discord

## Deploying to Discord

With Salt, you can deploy and run your workflows through the `Salt AI bot`.

When you’re ready to deploy, select the `Deploy` button in the top right corner. You will be prompted to give your workflow a name. Choose a unique, descriptive slug – your workflow will be discoverable by any Discord user using the Salt AI bot – then click `Deploy`.

You will see a confirmation screen when your deployment is complete. You can click to copy your workflow name to your clipboard.

You can manage and turn off your deployments at any time in the Deployments tab of your dashboard.

Salt’s Discord integration lets you easily put your workflows in the hands of real users as lightweight applications with no front-end development required. Keep reading to learn how.

## Installing the Salt AI Discord bot

You can easily add the Salt AI bot to any server or to your own account (accessible by DM) by selecting the `Add to Server` button [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1113909066587185274) or on the deployment confirmation screen.

## Running workflows in Discord

Once your workflow has been deployed to Discord, it is ready to be used by you and other users.

In any server with the Salt AI bot added, use the `/workflows` command to open the directory. You can enter the name of your workflow directly, copy and paste it, or simply type the `/workflows` command with your workflow’s name (example: `/workflow sample-workflow`) in the chat field to get started.

Once your workflow is selected, click `Run workflow` to open the prompt box. Enter your prompt and click `Submit`. Your output will be generated and appear in the thread or channel where you posted your message. You can also choose to set your workflow as your default every time you use the bot.

## Showcasing your workflows in the Salt catalog

To make your workflows discoverable to others in the community, first **[join the Salt Discord](https://discord.gg/saltai)** and complete onboarding.

Then, head to the **[#flow-catalog](https://discord.gg/FcbmPDf3E7)** channel and follow the example template to share your workflow. Be sure to run it using the Salt AI bot in a comment below and pin the comment, so others can easily grab and run it themselves.
