# Salt AI Next Generation
We're thrilled to announce Salt AI Next Generation â€” a ground-up rebuild of our platform launching December 10th, 2024. This represents a major evolution in how teams can build and deploy AI workflows.

## What's New

### Custom Node Creation
Build and integrate custom nodes directly in the platform. For the first time, you'll be able to create specialized nodes that perfectly match your workflow needs, all without leaving Salt.

### New Node Catalog
We've completely redesigned our node library with powerful new capabilities. This new catalog will replace our current node collection, bringing improved performance and functionality.

### Enhanced Core Platform
- Rebuilt workflow engine
- Streamlined user experience
- More powerful integration options
- Additional features coming soon

## Important Changes

The launch of Salt AI Next Generation includes some significant changes to the platform:

### Node Compatibility
